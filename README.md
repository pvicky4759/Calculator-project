    This a challenge-project listed in the Frontend-Mentor website.

*Challenge:  Create a working Calculator App , The design should be as exactly-similar to the design given in the website.

*Solution: I created this Calculator App using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Basically there are three themes given in the challenge   1.Classic Calculator theme
            2.Light theme
            3.Dark-purple theme

 Hiii I am vicky, I'm an aspiring Frontend developer.
  Currently I'm learning Javascript. While making this project, for the first time I used CSS-Grid.I learnt how Grids in CSS works. For me the Real challenge was to create the toggle that's responsible for the swapping of themes. After a little bit of research on the internet and Youtube Found this video from E-CODEC.Finally I was able to make the toggle and complete the challenge. I will really appreciate if someone reviews my code and give me some suggestion or point out any mistakes.
